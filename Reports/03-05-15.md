###Work Done
* Read from .xlsx file and write into a new .xlsx file with effort for a missing value. 
  - Unable to write into the same file as the existing styles would be lost. Have to check if I can retain them.
  - Generated effort will be in red font
  - Can be shown on local system.
* Test Rig for cocomo, peeker(2) and knn for the data by Dr Hihn. Few observations
  - Raw Attributes = ['MissionType', 'SecondaryElement', 'NumINstr', 'FlightComputerRedundancy','Total', 'Inheritance', 'Language']. Removed complexity as Dr Hihn said it was messed up.
  - Using raw attributes yields better results compared to cocomo attributes. TRUE?
  - Is it fair to compare them since the size of the datasets are different(17 for cocomo and 26 for raw).
  - Moreover logically, should attributes like "number of instruments" and "secondary element" determine effort involved?

### Queries
- Can I upload the tool repo on ncsu github as a private repo?
